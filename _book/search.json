Therefore, users will need to install using either Anaconda or pip.\nWithin the library are many functions and submodules that can be used depending on the purpose of the visualization. For this chapter, a progression series will be done on a randomly generated dataset in order to provide a comprehensive look into the visual elements that may be used for the graphs.\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nnp.random.seed(8465);"
