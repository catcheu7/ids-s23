For this assignment, the crashes in NYC in the month of January 2023 are analyzed.

```{python}

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import uszipcode as zcode
from uszipcode import SearchEngine

dfnyc = pd.read_csv("data/nyccrash_Jan2023.csv")

dfnyc.head()

```

2. We would like to see descriptions of all columns.

For numerical:

```{python}
dfnyc.describe()
```

For categorical:

```{python}
dfnyc.describe(include = 'object')
```

7. We want to see the frequencies for the contributing factors for vehicle 1.

```{python}
dfnyc["CONTRIBUTING FACTOR VEHICLE 1"].value_counts()
```

We then set all cases to upper in the column and redo the table.

```{python}

dfnyc["CONTRIBUTING FACTOR VEHICLE 1"].str.upper().value_counts()

```
