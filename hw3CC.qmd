For this assignment, the crashes in NYC in the month of January 2023 are analyzed.

```{python}

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import uszipcode as zcode
from uszipcode import SearchEngine

dfnyc = pd.read_csv("data/nyccrash_Jan2023.csv")

dfnyc.head()

```

2. We would like to see descriptions of all columns.

For numerical:

```{python}
dfnyc.describe()
```

For categorical:

```{python}
dfnyc.describe(include = 'object')
```

For missing:

```{python}
dfnyc.isnull().sum()/len(dfnyc)
```

3. Some coordinates are 0 which is nonsensical. We will correct them to NaNs.

```{python}
dfnyc[["LATITUDE", "LONGITUDE"]].replace(0.0, np.nan)
```

6. We will use the coodinates to fill in missing zip codes and boroughs.

```{python}
search = SearchEngine()
for row in dfnyc.itertuples():
	if ~np.isnan(row.LATITUDE) & ~np.isnan(row.LONGITUDE) & np.isnan(row.ZIP CODE) & np.isnan(row.BOROUGH):
		r = search.by_coordinates(row.LATITUDE, row.LONGITUDE)
		row.ZIP CODE = r[0]
```

7. We want to see the frequencies for the contributing factors for vehicle 1.

```{python}
dfnyc["CONTRIBUTING FACTOR VEHICLE 1"].value_counts()
```

We then set all cases to upper in the column and redo the table.

```{python}

dfnyc["CONTRIBUTING FACTOR VEHICLE 1"].str.upper().value_counts()

```
