For this assignment, the crashes in NYC in the month of January 2023 are analyzed.

```{python}

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import uszipcode as zcode

dfnyc = pd.read_csv("data/nyccrash_Jan2023.csv")

dfnyc.head()

```

2. We would like to see descriptions of all columns.

```{python}

dfnyc.describe()
```

```{python}
dfnyc["CONTRIBUTING FACTOR VEHICLE 1"].value_counts()
```

We then set all cases to upper in the column and redo the table.

```{python}

dfnyc["CONTRIBUTING FACTOR VEHICLE 1"].str.upper().value_counts()

```
