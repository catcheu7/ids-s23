# Introduction to matplotlib


## Introduction

Put an overview here. Use Markdown syntax.


## How to Use

The module is not a default package to Python. Therefore, users will need to install using either Anaconda or pip.

Within the library are many functions and submodules that can be used depending on the purpose of the visualization. For this chapter, a progression series will be done on a randomly generated dataset in order to provide a comprehensive look into the visual elements that may be used for the graphs.

```{python}
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.plotly as plt

#The plotly submodule is used for graphical elements.

np.random.seed(8465);

for i in range(1,100):
	xcoords = np.random.rand(0,4);
	ycoords = np.random.rand(0,4);
	fig = scatter(xcoords,ycoords);

```

## Animation

The animation submodule in matplotlib can simulate data.
